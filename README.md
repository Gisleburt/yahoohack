yMap
====

yMap is an extensible map plotter using the Open Layers implementation of Open Street Map.

It works by getting location data through [Yahoo! Place Finder][placefinder], using the [MMYQL ZF2 module][MMYQL] to query [YQL][YQL] and passing that data through other APIs to load other information, such as photos from [Flickr][flickr] or hotels from [Expedia][expeida].
